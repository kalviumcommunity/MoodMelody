# MoodMelody #

MoodMelody is a user-focused music recommendation system that leverages artificial intelligence to create personalized playlists based on how the user feels. Rather than relying on complex emotion detection algorithms, our first version puts the user in controlâ€”just tell us your mood, and we'll find the right music for you!

## Features ##

- **Simple Mood Input:** Users can select or enter their current mood.
- **Personalized Playlists:** Receive AI-recommended music playlists tailored to your emotional state.
- **Expandable Design:** Future versions can incorporate advanced emotion recognition (text, emoji, facial expression) as needed.

## Technologies Used ##

- Python (core logic)
- Flask or Django (web framework for user interface)
- Music API integration (e.g., Spotify, YouTube, or local song database)
- Optional: JavaScript, HTML/CSS for the frontend
